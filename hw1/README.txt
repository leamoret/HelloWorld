There are 4 files in my hw1 folder, they are:
1. README.txt : this file 
2. hw1.txt : text file with the answer to Problem 1 and Problem 2
3. perm.cpp : the program for Problem 4 
4. hw1_lists.cpp : the program for Problem 5

to compile perm.cpp:
g++ perm.cpp -o perm

to compile hw1_lists.cpp 
g++ hw1_lists.cpp -o hw1_lists

the program works with any input and output files 

I didn't really understand what was meant by "provide compile instructions". 
I basically followed all the intructions from the assingment on the 104 website.
